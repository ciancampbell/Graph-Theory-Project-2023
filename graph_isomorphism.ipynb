    "Graph: Graph is a mathematical representation of a network and it descibes the relationship between lines and points. A graph consists of some points and lines between them. Each objecct in a a graph is called a node.\n",

    "What is Isomorphic? \n",
    "\n",
    "Isomorphic: \"isomorphic\" means \"having the same form\" and is used in many branches of mathematics to identify mathematical objects which have the same structural properties. Objects which may be represented (or \"embedded\") differently but which have the same essential structure are often said to be \"identical up to an isomorphism.\"\n",
